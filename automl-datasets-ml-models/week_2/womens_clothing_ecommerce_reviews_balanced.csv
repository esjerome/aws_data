-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially  then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute  but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.,Blouses
-1,I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept  just didn't work for me.,Blouses
-1,I didn't really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail. i love cloth & stone and this is just not up to their normal quality. i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse. it's very soft  but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn't even tried them on yet. material is super soft  but thin. cut is weird under the arms and tight. sleeves are also tight! i am usually an xs or s in cloth & stone so i ordered smalls. i just fit the arms  but t,Blouses
-1,Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on,Blouses
-1,I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer  my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender  but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...    firstly  the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr,Blouses
-1,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.,Blouses
-1,As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.,Blouses
-1,Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.,Blouses
-1,Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.,Blouses
0,I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.,Blouses
0,The detail on this top is beautiful  love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad  but it is much too wide  bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is  another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides  because the top does not lay like that. it runs large  especially under the arms. too bad......,Blouses
0,I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.,Blouses
0,For fuller busted folks  this top may not work as it's unstructured and results in a tent from the boobs down. it's a shame--i found the gold embellishment beautiful.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful  the embroidery is well done  the fabric is soft  and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath  but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.,Blouses
0,"I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down  the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6"" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra",Blouses
0,First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful  but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short  but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it  i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size  and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still,Blouses
0,I wish this fit more to the body  it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful  so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.  fabric is light for summer  so if you are thin  not muscular  perhaps that would look great?,Blouses
1,Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look  you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!,Blouses
1,This top is a keeper. subtle plaid  flowy fit. so cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would definitely recommend!,Blouses
1,"This top is so cute  but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in  but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.",Blouses
1,Beautiful crepey fabric  lovely color. i was surprised to see gold threading in the peach option; i'm not a big gold thread fan  but it's do-able. the ruching across the back makes the fit very loose and blousy. this is not a figure-defining piece. but it's comfortable (will probably be more so after a wash to get that stiffy factory fabric finish feeling out)  and versatile.,Blouses
1,Love this top! runs true to size. exactly as pictured.,Blouses
1,Got this shirt in the green color. it's long and flowy and fits true to size. super comfy.,Blouses
1,This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!,Blouses
1,The color is a very dark mustard yellow  thin/light-weight material  and it has a pretty feminine drape. 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt. cute cuffs (complementary design). the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips. all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in. i'm usually between a s/m  i recommend the size up for hip fit.,Blouses
1,Love this top. the material is light  soft and comfortable. one thing to note. it runs very large? this feature is perfect for me as i was worried it would be too tight around the middle?this style would not look good if it didn't fit loose?..so i was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit me with plenty of room?.something i need for my full figure. if you are trim around the middle i recommend going down a size or two.,Blouses
-1,This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose  flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors  but way off.,Dresses
-1,I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight  and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me  but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe,Dresses
-1,Dress is pretty  i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep  i am returning. :(,Dresses
-1,This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful  vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.,Dresses
-1,I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size  however  it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump  this is a good choice. for others who are not  it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.,Dresses
-1,"I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4"" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i",Dresses
-1,This dress looked adorable online  but unfortunately  it's not flattering at all  and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.,Dresses
-1,I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing  but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft  the blue color is gorgeous  but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this  but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality  just does not fit a petite frame.,Dresses
-1,"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c",Dresses

0,I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug  but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.,Dresses
0,I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.,Dresses
0,This dress is cute and i will wear it to work. i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off. the print is cute  but a little bit odd  it's a swimmer in a cap. the tie is fun.,Dresses
0,The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package  unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect  the dress hangs nicely  no puffing  no stiffness. however  the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the,Dresses
0,I am pretty standard size 8  36c  5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;  150 lbs. i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste. it was also long so everything was very covered. i didn&amp;#39;t feel it flattered my build. i returned!,Dresses
0,I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper  i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly  i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver,Dresses
0,I love the design of this dress  but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn't cover my bra  and in fact  though the overall fit seemed right  the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i'm not large-chested  so this seemed like a design flaw to me.,Dresses
0,The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.,Dresses
1,I love this dress so much. it is more comfortable than any of my pajamas and the best part is it is very work appropriate  especially paired with chambray shirt buttoned and then tied at the waist.,Dresses
1,Love trying things outside my usual style  thought this might look like a sack but fell in love! looks effortless  easy to accessorize  dress up or down & comfortable. keeper! want to try it with platform sneaks for casual look.,Dresses
1,This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.,Dresses
1,I needed this dress as soon as i saw it on a mannequin in the store. unfortunately  when i tried on my usual size (4 regular)  the armholes were so big that you'd be able to see my bra no matter what. i purchased a 4 petite online later that day. it fits perfectly! i received so many compliments on this dress. a few issues though: (1) this dress wrinkles like crazy. i know it's linen  but i looked like a mess after wearing it for just a few hours. definitely don't wear it to work and expect to l,Dresses
1,Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.,Dresses
1,Easy to wear  get lots of compliments when i wear it. can be dressed up or down,Dresses
1,I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south  but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin  but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8  weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8  but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.,Dresses
1,Love this piece! i hope to see more cute  fun dresses like this from retailer. the greatest feature is it is super comfortable! it could be worn to a great number of events  dressed up or down for any occasion.,Dresses
1,Just had to review this dress because it is so beautiful. the fabric is light and soft  and is really perfect for this flowy tiered design. the colors are really pretty  not too bright  and it fit perfectly. i would say that it is much more dressy than it appeared in photos. the bodice has some beading  and it was much longer on me than on the model  though still a perfect maxi length. it would be perfect to wear to a wedding or formal affair.,Dresses
-1,"Nice fabric  great color  would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves  take a pass--too much like maternity wear  and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way.",Fine gauge
-1,"This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame  small-busted body.  i am 5'2"" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy  if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty.",Fine gauge
-1,Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,Fine gauge
-1,Online  this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact  i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately  this sweater will not work for me  as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.,Fine gauge
-1,As soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou,Fine gauge
-1,I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build,Fine gauge
-1,I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.,Fine gauge
-1,Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus  it's cream  not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.,Fine gauge
-1,I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.  wrong.  the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large  same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.  the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.,Fine gauge
0,"I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut  however  it was way too short. i am 5'6"" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it.",Fine gauge
0,Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top  lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.,Fine gauge
0,This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.,Fine gauge
0,"This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small.",Fine gauge
0,I love this sweater  so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color  it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.,Fine gauge
0,This is really cute but does run large  if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy  imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable  ugh why! i loved the sleeves  very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton  vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.,Fine gauge
0,Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.,Fine gauge
0,Loved this top  but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality,Fine gauge
0,This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very  very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.,Fine gauge

1,Cute sweater  but don't plan on wearing this until at least fall! i love the look of this and the quality of the knit is there  but this sweater runs large and it's heavy.. i normally wear an xl in most retailer tops/sweaters but i could probably wear a m in this sweater. i for sure need the petite size because this xl regular came to my knees and fit me like a coat. i ordered this online but am going to try and exchange it for a smaller size at the store  otherwise  i'll have to return it.,Fine gauge
1,This cardigan did not disappoint. i purchased the orange  which is a beautiful deep red orange that is perfect for fall. the fit is true to size and the length of the cardigan is nice  hitting at mid hip. the ruffles hang well and are not too bulky or overwhelming on my petite frame. it looks great from the side as well. i love the knitted details  the scallops  and the subtle gathers. the only flaw is that the sleeves are way too long to be practical. they come to my fingertips  so get in the w,Fine gauge

1,"Wasn't expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it's very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it's on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels  as another reviewer suggested. i'm 5'3"" petite. so  it doesn't swallow me",Fine gauge
1,I ordered this sweater and it is beautiful.... i am returning though because it fits snug through chest  shoulders and upper arms. i am an xs - and that is what i ordered and it was tight through these areas. if you are busty it would be a definite problem.,Fine gauge
1,This blouse if very pretty and feminine. i agree with the other reviews that said it emphasizes the size of your hips. i don't have any so it was great for me!,Fine gauge
1,I hadn't seen this sweater/jacket online or in store before shopping today. i purchased the ivory. it fits without being bulky whether or not it is zipped. great fit- true to size.the asymmetric zipper is a stylish detail. the pockets are well placed also. it is a perfect spring weight jacket or  i suspect  a comfy fall to winter sweater.,Fine gauge
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates

0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates

0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates

1,I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie  but the quality  fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this  but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand  it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut  the fabric is clearly lace  but beautifully done. and the feel is lov,Intimates

-1,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu,Jackets

-1,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!,Jackets
-1,I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,Jackets
-1,This is so close to perfect  but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket  and totally in love  when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match  but nope  on every one. couldn't unsee  didn't buy. very disappointed.,Jackets

0,It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,Jackets

0,These are very well-made jeans  the fabric is substantial and gives a lot of stretch with movement. i adore the extra inch or so in the rise of the waist  and they make my butt look great. however  these jeans fit like a glove when i put them on first thing  but within an hour or so of wear they are so baggy it's like wearing a size bigger. i'd say perhaps buy a size smaller if you want them to fit snugly through the day. if you like roomy  then buy your regular size.,Jeans

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering

0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.,Legwear

-1,I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown  although the width of the pant legs may have,Pants
-1,I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's,Pants
-1,Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.,Pants
0,The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.,Pants
0,These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j,Pants
0,I really love the look of this jumpsuit  casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and  similar to another reviewer  proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture  but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows  and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.,Pants
0,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!",Pants
0,I ordered a large  and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me  it was not. it ran a little small on top  buttons bulged at my chest  and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some  just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.,Pants

0,I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t,Pants

1,The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears  which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume  the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless  though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid,Pants

1,I'm a big fan of level 99 jeans and linen pants. these are great-- good quality  flattering fit  lovely color. i got the coral in size 26/petite  and that works for me. they do start out just a bit snug in the seat when i first put them on  but they'll pretty quickly stretch out just enough to maintain shape without becoming baggy  like my other level 99 linens-- something to keep in mind when trying to find your right fit. i was a little worried that the drawstring meant there wouldn't be much,Pants

-1,"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops.     the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online.     the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good.     they're also really tight compar",Shorts

-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts
-1,"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",Shorts
-1,I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.,Shorts
0,"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",Shorts
0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,Shorts

0,I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,Shorts
0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt,Shorts
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,Shorts

-1,The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.,Skirts

-1,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,Skirts
-1,This looked beautiful online  but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels  with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch  and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.  a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.,Skirts

0,I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.,Skirts
0,I am so in love with this skirt  but unfortunately it runs at least one size small...since i am a 16 there is no sizing up. the color  quality  and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior's sizing than a regular women's size. so sad because it will be going back.,Skirts
