# aws_data

Repository with all the material developed during the specialization in applied data science offered by AWS and coursera. Each folder contains what corresponds to what was developed in each work week with a main notebook. The notebooks were run in a sagemaker lab therefore some commands will not work using a Jupyter or Google Colab notebook
