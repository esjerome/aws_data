__label__0 "close but no cigar ... the design and color were cute . the sweater itself was too warm for me and itchy . the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom it almost had strange fold in the front . look closely at some of the photos and you 'll see what i mean . sadly it went back ."
__label__1 "i love the style and quality of this blouse . it can easily be dressed up or down . the blouse is completely see through and delicate . still it is so romantic feminine distinctive and timeless ."
__label__-1 "maybe it 's because i 'm 40 but this top was underwhelming . i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big obnoxious bow on the back . it does look cute on the model so maybe it 's a younger top . i would have felt silly wearing it ."
__label__0 "the colors of this top are perfect for spring i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom . what i did n't like and primary reason i may be returning is the elastic bottom . it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide . i am very disappointed about this as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous ."
__label__1 "i saw this tee and was unsure about the print but decided to give it a try . i 'm glad i did as it has become a weekend staple ."
__label__-1 "this top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types . i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips ... will be returning ."
__label__1 "this is my third dress-the first one was the right size but the plaid fell on the dress in an awkward way . the second one was a size too small but this one is perfect ! i am wearing it with a belt and loving it !"
__label__-1 "this blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great . i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest ! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions ! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side !"
__label__0 "this looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips ."
__label__1 "this dress is so gorgeous ! it fits perfectly is stretchy wonderful comfortable and the fabric is nice and thick with beautiful texture . i absolutely love it ! i 'm 5 ' 6 125 lbs with a pretty athletic build and it fits like a dream ! i love the color the fabric the fit the stretch the comfort the sexyness of it ..... it 's my new favorite ! highly recommended !"
__label__1 "the material of the lace is nice and soft it is not a stiff lace . i am 5 ' 6 36dd 146lbs and ordered the small . it fits perfect not tight through bust or the arm holes . i wore today for the first time and everyone that sees the top loves it as much as i do . i ordered the white and in the pictures it looks like a bright white it is not . it is more of an antique white and i am wearing a nude colored camisole and it works perfect . i think it will be really cute with a colored cami also . this will"

__label__0 "i bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color . however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible . i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective ... it did n't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed . after that alteration ( on my own dime ) i was very happy with the dress and"

__label__0 "i really wanted to love this dress .... i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it . sadly the top was just too balloon like and poofed out way too much . i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit . if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome . i do n't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue ... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it ."
__label__1 "this top is very pretty and looks expensive and as pictured nice pattern and could be dressed up or down the gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch however the back of the top has strange bat wing-like design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the top sadly i think i may send it back ."

__label__0 "i had mixed feelings about this dress . the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd . it has two slips one that fits close and a second that 's a bit too puffy . so the skirt did n't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger . the odd length made it unflattering . it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i did n't want to risk it ."
__label__1 "i was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter . this shirt looks great on its own but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests etc . it 's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality but it is holding up well so far ."
__label__-1 "really like this dress but ..... the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes . impossible ! has to go back"
__label__-1 "i loved this dress when i saw it . however the fit was way off . i am 5 ' 7 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down . when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect . unfortunately the waist hit way too high above my rib cage and the dress was too short . it was as if it was a petite size . i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty easy dress to just throw on for school . unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both . the material is also not the s"

__label__1 "this dress is super comfy and really cute ! i was worried that the horizontal stripes might not be flattering but they did n't make me look larger at all . it 's great for casual wear but can easily be dressed up with a jacket and booties ."
__label__1 "sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly . i am 5 ' 6 and 165lbs just fyi . dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body . it 's very slimming . looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding"
__label__-1 "i tried on this sweater ... love the flowing top and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline . wrong . the seam came right across my bust on a medium ; sized up to a large same thing . this should n't happen ! not sure who this would actually flatter . the sweater is high quality and the colors are perfect . the fit needs work ."
__label__0 "i love the designs of tiny blouses . but i wish they could make them more durable . i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam . and ironing or steaming them is a must . this blouse was no exception . it went back because of pulling at the bust . i 'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule but i should n't have to ! 5 ' 7"
__label__0 "the styling of this top is really cute . it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look . my biggest complaint is the quality ! it 's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer . it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge it curls really badly . i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time . not worth the $ $ if paying full price ."
__label__-1 "appears much more sleek in the photograph . in real life this shirt looks more like a pajama top . thin extremely casual not worth the price i paid- even in black . will be exchanging it tomorrow ."
__label__1 "beautiful and comfy ! ! ! ! love it !"
__label__-1 "these felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves . i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs . an alternative would be to clip the elastic but ultimately decided to return ."
__label__1 "love these vintage soft jeans .. they do run small so be sure get a size larger .. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28 ... look amazing with boots flip flops and slip ons ... love mother jeans .. work every time"
__label__0 "this would be great on someone with a slim build . it 's very true to size it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look . i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way . note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear ( and spring back with cleaning ) ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these twice just to be sure there was n't a glitch . the color is so off ! the picture shows a dark blue denim but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering ! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading ."
__label__0 "this top fit me great across the bust - true to size there however it was very loose other than that ( outside of the peplum of course ) . it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top . i was wider than i should be/am . this may work on some body types but did not work for me . it was a nice feeling comfortable top however ."
__label__0 "they were ok pants but too small . the texture and shape were not what i expected either ."
__label__-1 "love this top ! it 's pretty unique and well made . i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on . the arms are so tight ! i ordered in a m which is my normal retailer size but could n't move my arms . took it back was going to try in a l but store did n't have any . for the price i need to be able to move my arms !"
__label__1 "great print and material but this top runs large . i 'm 36c and usually wear l in most lines retailer carries but this was just big . i reordered in a medium ."
__label__0 "this dress is beautiful it just swallowed my small frame whole ! the colors and design are gorgeous just not a good fit for me even at a 0p ."
__label__1 "love these ! so comfy and a great color ! also love that it came in petite ! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite ! ! !"
__label__-1 "this is a cute dress but not for me . 1. i think it runs very small 2. it is super textured so if you do n't want to add bulk ( aka pounds ) to your frame this probably is n't for you . it 's too bad it 's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first . i 'm sure it 's probably adorable on smaller thinner people . unfortunately mine is going back ."
__label__-1 "the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate . but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used . although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that -- it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress . and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they 're asking for it . maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail"
__label__1 "great with leggings and skinny jeans ! it 's comfortable too !"

__label__-1 "i bought 3 shirts in gold black and red . they arrived larger than expected . after the first wash and air dry they shrunk . i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide . also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash ."

__label__0 "i ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes . neither fit ... both were very tight ... runs very small ."
__label__0 "so much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit . the top is sort of tight in the bust even with a small chest . the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top but then tight on even my skinny arms . the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on ... just too much effort . it is otherwise a beautiful pattern color and length . just a miss for me personally in the fit department . bummer !"
__label__-1 "this is cut very strangely i 'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button . the material is rough and scratchy . did not like at all and will be returning ."
__label__0 "love the color but the fit is just odd and frumpy . the sleeves are shorter than the should be . when i lift my arms the entire sweater gets lifted . going back ."

__label__-1 "this shirt aesthetically is very pleasing . i love the overall design and colors . however when i tried it on i was immediately itchy ! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be . in addition though i ordered a size medium it fit very large - almost too oversized . the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big . it 's too bad i really loved the look but i 'm not the type to layer . if you are go for it but get a size smaller than you normally would !"
__label__-1 "disappointed : - ( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me . i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me . bummer ! i liked the quality and weight ( not too heavy nor too light ) but shape is unflattering . it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i so loved this dress online . not so much in person . first of all it did n't fit my build . i 'm 5 ' 4 with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering . mainly i 'm returning it because of the fabric . the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out . my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed . basically it 's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat . if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful . why they made i"

__label__0 "i am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear . i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons . when i received it it looked exactly as it does in the picture online however the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big . the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day . it 's definitely a comfortable shirt but it felt more like a pajama top . it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress when i saw it online perfect for a summer wedding but when i tried it on i was very disappointed . the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured . there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely it made me look very large . i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail . sadly it will have to go back . it may look good on a very thin frame but did n't complement my average one ."

__label__0 "got this in the mail today and while the design is cute it 's not as soft and comfortable as i would like . the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off . the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit ."
__label__0 "this style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly however this did not fit me one bit . the waist was too large the length too short and the hips too small . i was really hoping this would fit since it 's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft . i will be returning this ."
__label__-1 "this top has a nice design . i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape . if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist . however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank . it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area which i could have easily fixed . it is very sheer ; even with a nude bra my bra was too visible for my comfort . plan on wearing a full camisole underneath tank or bralette you are fine with being on display ."

__label__-1 "i do n't know how to explain but this dress at least for me did not look like the model first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts for me it did n't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking ... so definitely not for my type of body i am normal height ( 5 ' 5 '' athletic and curvy body ) but maybe for a very tall person looks good ! the material is very interesting it 's so soft !"
__label__-1 "i was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer . for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses . the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all . the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown . this dress has no shape to it although probably comfortable not flattering . i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture in person ."

__label__-1 "the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige . well i 'm blonde with fair skin so i 'm not sure this is going to work . it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual . i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts"
__label__0 "i purchased the green dress in medium . i usually wear a medium . the fabric is pretty . shoulders fit nicely . sleeves were short in an odd length but that is indeed pictured accurately . the body of the dress is very shapeless billowy and wide which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown . i considered altering the garment by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward but i decided to return the dress ."
__label__1 "this dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger . the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size . i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly . it is a bit short however so i would caution that it may not be work office appropriate if you are taller . like most hd in paris dresses it is also quite thin although lined . this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or"
__label__0 "i love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved . this one was a fail . i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me . i am 34c 127 # . the moment i put it on it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe . it flares quite a bit and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping . the quality is as expected . the color overall is as it looks online . but it was a return ."
__label__0 "thought this looked so cute especially for averting frame . it arrived and was too large the fabric felt super cheap and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent .... and not in a good way . returned ."
__label__1 "love this top dramatic in a casual way . i ordered the teal and love love love it .... with skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect ! i am over 50 so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriate . i ordered the blue also a very pretty shade of blue ......... but felt in this style the bright/light colors would be more appropriate for someone younger . it 's a stunning top ........... and fits very true to size .......... the drama of the ruffle is what sets it apart .. hoping they do"
__label__0 "i love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious"
__label__1 "this dress pops ! gorgeous colors and simple classic flowy design . i thought it ran a little big i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow . 34b for reference ."

__label__1 "i bought this in black last year and i love it . i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops are n't really my style and these prints would n't be so easy to mix and match . please offer in other solid colors ! i would buy all of them this skirt is really that fabulous . not only does it fit well and run true to size it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on and gives a little more tummy coverage . but not too much ! somehow it hits me a"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy soft cotton but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true . it 's incredibly sheer - you 'd have to wear a cami underneath which defeated the point for me . the pleating in the front hides your bra but you can see it from all other angles ( i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra which can easily hide under sheer clothing ) . i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to"
__label__1 "i love this top . it 's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams . it 's super soft and comes in some great colors . i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee !"
__label__1 "these pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy . the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants . there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well which i like ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress and after i got it on . as others mentioned it is difficult to get it on . i wish that the bow snapped on and off . as i took the dress off the bow came off itself . unfortunately going to be returning the dress ."
__label__1 "i saw this dress in my local retailer store and am not sure why i did not try it on then but later at home it began to haunt me . i loved the colored embroidery against the black . my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that would n't take up too much room and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little . online i saw that it was available in the petite and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite"
__label__-1 "i usually love tops like this i bought this is the store because if was so soft . got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in ."
__label__1 "perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort . the high waist does n't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over . perfect to go with crop tops"
__label__-1 "this shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips . the fit at the top is tight ( i ordered a small ) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller ( i am 5 ' 7 ) it hits at a place that is not flattering . i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings . this is not it ... also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting ."
__label__-1 "i usually wear a medium and bought a small . it fit ok but had no shape and was not flattering . i love baby doll dresses and tops but this was a tent . my daughter saw me try it on and said that 's a piece of tablecloth . it 's going back ."
__label__0 "i wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me which is surprising . they also do n't lay really flat in the back . the pockets are inside in the back in side two layers and do n't lay very flat . the crotch is low and rides up when i walk . i 'll probably wear them again but i 'm not totally thrilled by them ."
__label__1 "very nice top fits true to size a little short buy looks nice with jeans or work pants"
__label__-1 "i loved the dress but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed . very easy order and return . thanks !"
__label__0 "i decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet . i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured only about 3 inches shorter . i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late everything i seem to order is huge . this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured a nice green . fabric was a gauzy cotton . the dress was just alright . nothing special to warrant the price tag . it felt like a little girl 's dress on me"
__label__1 "the perfect pair . i am 5 ' 6 . 130lb and ordered size 28 and it fits just right . it is a little stretchy so molds to your shape . the legs are slender but not too fitted . no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt ."
__label__1 "this top is an amazing go to piece and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto . i will say that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear . therefore it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time . good staple for a great price ."
__label__1 "really great best . nice substantial material and great fit . will be able to wear with many things ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit . i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big . if you are normally a size 24 i would n't bother with these ."
__label__1 "love this dress so much ! i bought the cranberry color first and i loved it so much that i also bought it in black . i think it runs fairly true to size . i am 5 ' 3 and about 110 and the xs petite fit perfectly . i tried the xs and it was pretty large on my frame . i love the fabric and flow of this dress and i love the pockets ."
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online . the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it . i 'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package . trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing . it really is very cute on ."
__label__0 "very soft material length is great a little more loose than i would have liked ."
__label__-1 "why is it so difficult to find a shirt that does n't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm ? this is cute ( beyond the arm hole issue ) but overpriced . going back ."
__label__1 "so cozy and warm great for the cold nights !"
__label__0 "the fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me . sadly it looked ridiculous on me . i would n't recommend the top for busty girls . it looked like a bell on me . fyi it does n't come with a camisole underneath ."
__label__1 "very pretty dress but the fit is not great . i have to get help to take it off because it 's tight in the shoulders ."
__label__-1 "i was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted they were short . very weird look for a wrap . returned ."
__label__0 "this dress had a nice silhouette but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would 've made a nice casual dress !"
__label__-1 "i was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed . i tried it on and i was correct .... it looked like i was wearing a huge tent . i returned it ."

__label__0 "i love the wide straps but it runs small and is short . still great for layering . great soft material . i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big ."
__label__1 "perfect except a little snug around the hips . very forgiving silhouette ."
__label__-1 "looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment both the colors and style . the material seems great quality but it 's stiff and scratchy the style is very boxy and as another reviewer said just hung . i 'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me . back it goes ."
__label__0 "this is a cute dress but just not a keeper for me . the top portion of the dress is fairly snug . i am normally a small in retailer sizes but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust . otherwise it was cute and simple and the tulle was quite soft . i think that i would have gone with a medium but i am wearing a small in the photo . for reference i am 5 ' 5 ~135 lbs 34c and 27 waist ."
__label__-1 "this did n't work for me . it looks better unzipped . the piece made me look extremely top heavy and i am by no means overweight but i do have a larger chest on a small frame ( 36c 5 feet 115 ) . honestly it just made me look fat . the design is cute but this is going back .."
__label__1 "i got the purple color and absolutely love it . i am 5 ' 2 but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer . i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm . it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely !"
__label__0 "the green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho ."
__label__-1 "the cut and color of the dress is awesome . however the biggest flaw is the zipper . i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke .. sad day especially at the price . there also were a number of loose threads . i recommend waiting until it goes on sale . you 'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful both the print and the material . then i tried it on and it fit like a tent . i am just under 5 ' 5 and it hit right below my knees not like shown in the picture here . on that note i passed on this one due to the fit . i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though ."
__label__1 "i have been wanting this skirt since it came out and was overjoyed when it went on sale . i got my typical 00 size ( 24-26 waist xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses ) but when i tried it on i was a bit confused . the waist is a little roomy so there 's no way i could wear a 0 but the skirt hugs my butt . and i 'm talking in that weird hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way . now i do n't consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department but this skirt sure says the opposite ! i can '"
__label__0 "i ordered this top online and was hoping to love it however it did n't fit me properly ... the arm holes were much too large ( i 'm typically an xs or small ) i ordered the small and based on this fit i do n't think the extra small would 've fit either : ( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin .... and with 3 kids always hanging on me i do n't think this top would last very long ..."
__label__-1 "i love ( d ) this top . it was my go to top even in the heat the fabric is light and breathes . however pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body . it could not be repaired . i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it ."
__label__1 "the blouse is lightweight and is double layered meaning a light layer over a lower layer . it 's not bulky and not super flowy ... just enough . i 'm 5 ' 1 a bit busty and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great . it 's figure flattering and not boxy . may be a tad short for taller women ."
__label__0 "this shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person . i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it ! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help ."
__label__-1 "i was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model . i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable . i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it was n't as form fitting as i would have liked . i ended up returning this dress ."

__label__1 "absolutely love this little shift ! ! ! i bought it on a whim really . it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80 's ! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar : - ) this is not that sort of velvet . it 's also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet . i always find those to have a somewhat plastic sheen to them . that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur"
__label__-1 "this top arrived today and after trying it on i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100 % without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture . the fit is designed to be loose so i do n't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down . i 've included a picture of how it fits naturally and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back . it 's still a cute shirt just not the flattering top i was expecting . i 'm debating on"

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this jumpsuit . it looks adorable in the product photo . i am 5 ' 5 about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me . i tried everything -- - pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line wearing a variety of heel heights -- -- i could n't seem to make it work . there was just so much fabric on me ! it felt like i was wearing pajamas ( and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out ' way ) . i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut . on me this jumpsuit was just"
__label__0 "dress cut was great but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy . it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering . also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person . i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it ."
__label__1 "i wanted to comment about the wash. yes these jeans look really ? dirty ? when you pull them out of the package . but after a few months of washing the dirty color has really mellowed . also i am a usual 26 in jeans purchased these in 25 and could have fit into the 24. i may purchase another pair these jeans are really unique comfortable great for the summer with sandals or converse ."
__label__-1 "i just got this in the mail the other day . i was really excited and then crushed . one buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo . it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling . it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours . i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail . it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back . too bad but not what i bought and then not"

__label__-1 "darling jacket/coat similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love . i was considering this one but the description says to hand wash. seriously ? a coat ? that 's simply not practical . not sure if i will buy this one ."
__label__-1 "this open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric . even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it ."
__label__1 "i consider myself fairly busty ( 34 d ) but i did n't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium ..... i actually went with the small . the lace inset does n't give but it was n't tight at all . i love the flow of the blouse .... it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall !"
__label__1 "the label says 100 % linen but it 's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen . it 's not a scratchy linen at all . it 's a very very fine knit but the top is not sheer . i do not think you need a cami under it . i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown . it has a slight drape but it 's not really baggy at all . i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is . it 's a bit darker and has a silver essence also . i liked this so much i just bought another one in mauve ."
__label__0 "the sweater fits a bit awkward in the front . it draped more than i would have liked . also the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching . returned the item ."
__label__0 "i love the look of this top . i 'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big and looked a little like a maternity top . i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately it still looked maternity-ish . i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all it will look like a maternity top on you ."
__label__-1 "i bought this dress in an xs and am 5 ' 4 115 lbs and fairly proportional . the shoulders were snug but the hips ( and maybe waist ) were at least 2-3x too big . comically so -- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side ."
__label__1 "crazy soft and comfy . light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering . so happy i bought it ."
__label__1 "i love these pants . i vary between 10 & 12 the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom . so many colors to coordinate with these pants . teal green retailer yellow black ... i am not fond of ankle pants prefer longer pants . i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants . the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made removing the cuff tacks was a challenge ! perfect pants for those of us who have shape"
__label__1 "i loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater . it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater . the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed . but overall this is a lovely sweater !"
__label__0 "i found this dress to run very large . the fabric was substantial but rather coarse . also the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream ."
__label__1 "i just discovered this dress a few days ago and it 's simply dreamy ! ! i 'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops . this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june ! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest . the lace cut-outs are gorgeous !"
__label__0 "i like design of the dress softness and color ( i got grey ) the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5 ' 6 145 lbs ) i got m fits ok but i do n't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time . despite i got it with 40 % discount it will come back as it 's poor quality ."
__label__-1 "so much right but then .... too short ."
__label__1 "button down shirts usually are n't my thing but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look . it 's also easy to dress up or down which is great ! i am 5 ' 4 and small-framed and the size 0 fits just right ."
__label__1 "i ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner . i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height . i was for sure it would be too short in any other size . when i put it on i was drowning in it ! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal . has the potential to be super cute and flattering yet the timing and sizing did n't work out . definitely give this one a try !"
__label__1 "this is my favorite shirt to wear around the house . it 's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice i 'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood . the fabric is thin but is n't too delicate and it 's not sheer which makes it a great summer lounge shirt . the cut is flattering and the back does n't show my bra which too many of this design do . it is a bit large you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious ."
__label__1 "love this skirt ! i thought it would be much shorter but when i tried it on it was the perfect length and super cute ! ! the material is thick but not uncomfortable and very move able !"
__label__0 "very cute dress just way too big . i ordered it online wish i would have gone a size smaller ."
__label__1 "this dress is everything . i 'm 5 ' 4 athletic build 36d and the medium fit me perfectly . the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down . i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that 's one of those things only i notice and definitely did n't keep me from falling in love and buying it . ca n't wait to wear it on vacation next week !"
__label__-1 "very nice fabric and quality but runs very large . i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture ."
__label__0 "i was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i 'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is . i returned it ."
__label__1 "i hope you can get this top.this is a great classic that will be in my closet for a long time ."
__label__1 "i can not say enough good things about this dress . as a petite person ( 5 ' 0 ) it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations but this dress fit perfectly . it 's also so well-made : the fabric is soft comfortable and gorgeously detailed and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume ( in a good flattering way ) ! i got it shortened by about 2 but this dress fits like a dream ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be . it was tts ( i 'm 53 and usually wear a small ) . but the material was horribly scratchy . both the body of the top as well as the sleeves . and the design is n't all that flattering . it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life !"
__label__-1 "i was thoroughly underwhelmed . it did not hang well and the fit seemed off . the tie waist just sort of hung there . i could have sized down but i did n't even want to bother . it was pretty boring and flimsy for $ 138 ."
__label__0 "i have to send the skirt back . i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high the underskirt bunches and the fabric snags easily . additionally the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band . disappointed in the quality of this skirt given the pretty steep price ."
__label__-1 "i was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it 's going back because the knit is just too thin . i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it 's not . and because it 's so light the swing effect does n't really come off . nothing special ."
__label__-1 "this top runs super small in the upper arms shoulder area .. could not even stretch out my arms ! ... other then that major problem the length and body fit were perfect ... i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10 12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit ... disappointed because it really is a beautiful top ..."
__label__1 "this dress is gorgeous in person soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets . it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing . i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses . i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it . it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear . the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow . expensive maybe but well worth it ."
__label__0 "i really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple ! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 ( my typical size ) - the jumpsuit does n't have a waist i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist . most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow . also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it 's the longest zipper i 've ever seen . it 's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any . i will sadl"
__label__1 "i just ordered this item and wore it yesterday . received compliments from my friends . truly a great sweater . feels soft to the touch . i love the cut and how it falls around my hips . sleeves were nice and long . i am a tall lady with long arms . almost 6 ft weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me . love the off white . almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too ."
__label__1 "i found this today on the one and only rack . i absolutely fell in love with it . i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly . other customers were asking where they could find it in the store . i highly recommend . it can be dressed up or down ."

__label__0 "i got the pink version . it is a pretty color but the metallic border is painted not a metallic yarn . the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy . it looks cheap to me -- not what i expect from retailer . am returning ."
__label__1 "this dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger . the material clings to all the right places and feels really good . i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on . would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable . if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it . adorable !"
__label__0 "the design of this dress is darling and so unique and it 's very well made . but i agree it 's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame . i 'm 5 ' 3 and ordered the 2 and it was like wearing a hospital gown . if a petite were available i 'd have tried that but this one 's going back . shame too because it 's adorable . the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut but that 's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high ."
__label__1 "i received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another ! beware because the color names are confusing . i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the red thinking i 'd get the red colored tee . however the red tee is actually a light orange color . the orange tee is actually a burgundy/red color . i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color because i really do love the quality of this shirt !"
__label__-1 "these socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid . i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf . i would not recommend this product . it felt very cheap and not of good quality ."
__label__1 "i bought this top in 2 colors . it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear so i bought it in the 3rd color . it 's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel weekends and work . the feel of the fabric is gorgeous but it pills after wear . so when the top went on sale i bought an extra set of all 3 colors . now i have a set for play and a set for work . i love this shirt ."
__label__1 "looks exactly as it does in the pictures . very comfortable loose flowing and has a slip underneath it . i 'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it 's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size . with that i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large but thankfully the medium fits like a glove !"
__label__0 "i am 5 ' 4 100lbs petite frame i bought this dress in xxsp . the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined good for fall maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days but perhaps a cooler summer day . unfortunately this dress runs pretty large much too large for my petite frame so i had to return it . i would recommend sizing down . this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event ."
__label__1 "i have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them . i had to get these when i saw them in the store . i 'm a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring . i also love the dark wash. i was surprised when i tried on my usual size 27 that they were too tight . i ended up going with a size 28. for reference i am 5 ' 4 122 lbs ."
__label__0 "this is a very pretty jacket . light weight and perfect for spring/fall . i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store . i did end up returning it though . it does run large i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look ! i was sad to have to send this one back ! i was hoping to love it ! someone smaller might love it ! !"
__label__1 "this top is very versatile . i wore it out to dinner with skinny jeans on a friday night but it can easily transition to a saturday afternoon stroll around town top ."
__label__1 "one of the best maxi dresses i have ever found ! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust ( 36g ) and camouflage my postpartum belly . the dress did it all . i ordered the large ( 5 ' 7 and 155 lbs ) and it is so flattering . it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty . and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer . like i said best maxi dress ever . price is pretty high but it was worth it !"
__label__1 "absolutely love this dress ! i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline but flipped it around for an evening night out . ca n't recommend it enough - two of my colleagues ordered it that day ."
__label__-1 "i loved fabric print and back detail . design however was a little too boxy to be flattering on me . even at great price i sent it back ."
__label__0 "first off the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top . the material is thick and pleasant feeling the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done . however i just could n't get past the fit issue which was also mentioned by the other reviewers . i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest and it was loose in all the wrong places . i 'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me but i 'm afraid it would be too snug . this may look awesome on someone else but i had to ret"
__label__-1 "i ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice . once i tried it on it was way too big in hips . i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides . i returned the dress ."
__label__0 "this is a busy dress that makes me think boho-glam holly hobby . i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me . i 'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more . i 'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style ."
__label__1 "the fabric is breathtaking both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone . as usual eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size size regular 6 ( i am 5ft2in 34b 26 waist 36 hips ) fit well the hem is below my knees appropriate for work . but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress . the top part looks strange does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me thus one star off ."
__label__0 "the idea of this dress is lovely . the fabric is pleasing to the touch . the print manages to be eye catching but understated . i do n't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing . i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance . i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly . the top fits poorly . i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders . how"

__label__0 "this is a flattering comfortable soft sweater the instant you put it on . a few instants after that however i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity . i 'm not optimistic about its longevity and would n't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer ."
__label__0 "a little boxy but will be a go to basic . the off set ruffle gives interest"
__label__0 "the pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering . the expected delivery date kept slipping . the color is not as shown online . online it looks like a light pink . the actual top was more of taupe color . it 's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom . not enough to keep ."
__label__1 "i ordered this bra in my normal size 32d and it fits me perfectly . this bra is beautiful . the material seems to be very high quality and the comfort of this bra is amazing . it 's definitely a keeper ."
__label__1 "bought this skirt in the light plum color . nice soft corduroy fabric . it fit well . not too short . will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots . my only complaint . i wish it had pockets ."
__label__0 "this top is really cute online but that 's about it . it runs large but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this because the reviews were outstanding . i am returning it . although the embroidery looks fine on screen in person it looks cheap and tacky . moreover the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy . overpriced to boot . obviously mine is a minority opinion ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous ! i really loved it until i put it on . wow it was bad . i ordered a small -- normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material . it was n't long but rather incredibly boxy . one of the most unflattering things i 've ever tried at retailer ."
__label__1 "i just purchased this top in the store . it is definitely not tunic length as shown here but rather hip length . also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size . but it is adorable ."
__label__1 "although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me ! love the material style just does n't look right on me !"
__label__-1 "this top is too short so much so that tucking it in would be difficult . the designs are lovely but the short length is putting this top back on the rack ."
__label__0 "i love this dress ! the print and the fabric make it a fun uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily . that being said there are two issues i wish i had known about although i probably would have purchased anyway . 1 ) it has pockets -yay ! ! ! but also the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it 's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge . 2 ) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron are n't friends anymore . so i thr"
__label__0 "this is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit . material is very thin . i ordered white which was completely see-through . not at all what i was expecting . might work better in a darker color but i returned it since it was nothing special ."
__label__1 "this dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites ! ( i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering ... so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well ! ) i ordered in the 2p . i am 5 ' 4 about 120 # . it fits beautifully ... even though it 's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p ( it is no longer available though ) . but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"
__label__0 "i was on the fence about this dress because even on the model it 's a little bit frumpy but it was so pretty that i tried it . however on my short frame it 's even frumpier . the quality is very good the fabric is soft and it 's lined . the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering . i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin . i am 5 ' 4 110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p but even the petite was too saggy . i needed a"
__label__-1 "this skirt was horrible on me . it was loose in the waist tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom . the material also felt cheap and clingy . i guess the fit is tts but it 's hard to tell given how strange the cut was ."
__label__1 "comfortable shorts . thinner fabric . pattern disguises underwear lines . love the exterior pockets as i wo n't have to tuck them in when i zip up . as the previous reviewer said the black and white pattern has blue accents . they 're mid-rise and a longer length which i appreciate ."
__label__-1 "this skirt has no closure along the slit . i ca n't begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo-you would be completely exposed . it completely baffled me"
__label__-1 "i love relaxed-fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string so naturally i was super excited to see these . i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag material was soft and flowy but not too thin . unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller i barely could get them on and i could not zip up . i 'd need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all . very disappointed will l"
__label__0 "i was so excited when this dress went on sale . it is very soft and the print is so distinctive . it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all . i am a curvy girl wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide ! the skirt is quit full a small would have fit but the top was tight . so disappointing ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this in the mail and so disappointed when i put it on . it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up but i do n't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams ? i do n't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area . returned it the next day ."
__label__0 "i really wanted this to work . alas it had a strange fit for me . the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast . it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders . the fabric was beautiful ! and i loved that it had pockets ."
__label__1 "this shirt looked so perfect on the model and i was so excited to get it ! when i received it it was so soft and the color was so vibrant . the only thing is it 's too big . it kind of looks like a maternity shirt . it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me but i 'm happy with it other than that . i 'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time ."
__label__1 "this dress is stunning ! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes . it fit beautifully on my 5'10 frame . unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids . while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles it made the shorter girls look shorter . i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now !"
__label__0 "i loved the dog on this sweater and i rushed into the store to buy it . once i tried it on like others i did find it to be itchy but that i could deal with using a tank or something . what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut . my arms looked much bigger than they are so sadly i left it at the store . it really is a cute sweater though ..."
__label__-1 "this is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide . very disappointing ! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me . i do n't usually wear xxs . it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly . i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look . nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit . going back to the store ."
__label__-1 "loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding . unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else . it fit well but was poorly made . based off other reviews this is n't the first time this has happened with this dress ! not worth the risk at all ."
__label__0 "i ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer 's comment that they were unflattering on the back side . they really do hug your bum but that is not what bothers me . what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top they are not wearable in public or around other people . i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer but also some of the most poorly designed . unfortunately these fall in the latter category ."
__label__1 "this dress just feels and looks amazing . i love how it is n't too short like a lot of new styles . i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter . i also love the plaid cuff detail . the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced . i got home and realized one button was missing . i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms 2 buttons popped off !"
__label__0 "this top is adorable and has a looser fit ( as shown on the model shot ) so i would have liked to size down ; however the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there 's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down . if you have slim arms maybe you could size down and make this work ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in a size 8 my normal size at retailer . it is a lovely dress and so feminine but it is incorrectly sized . i could n't begin to button it . i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything . buyer beware . unless you are itsy bitsy you need to size up . i will say that as pretty as the photos are the dress is even more lovely in person ."
__label__1 "fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets"
__label__-1 "no . this is one of the most unflattering things i 've ever put on my body . i 'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge . do n't do it ."
__label__-1 "good reason to read reviews . i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy . heavy fabric makes matters worse ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i pre-ordered it and waiting 2 weeks for it arrive . when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought . i 'm not sure if i misunderstood the images but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over i just thought that the fabric had a texture . the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me . i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am . i think this w"
__label__1 "this dress is so flattering on i was astounded . often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though i 'm only 5 ' 1 tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall . the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring . would be great for work or church but unfortunately does n't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price . i highly recommend"
__label__1 "i loved this dress the moment i first saw it ! i have another dress from this brand that i 've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail . however after trying this dress in both a size medium ( my typical size ) and a small i 've given up . it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b there is room in the chest even in the size small . so would look really good on a curvy girl ! i 'm 5 ' 5 ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees ."
__label__1 "i have these in grey and i love them ! they are so comfy . i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit . they are very soft ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress in store today in a size 4 i usually wear an 8 ( so i was thrilled ) the print and details are gorgeous but it 's a very wide swing dress there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist . i 'm going to wear this with a belt so it 's fine but the images online are a little misleading ."
__label__0 "i have the blue and gray and love the look and feel . however the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas ."
__label__0 "this dress is adorable and well made . this brand runs on the large side . i ordered an xs and the tag says ' p on it . it 's not petite . it ran large through the hips and will need alteration . i 'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made . the material is knit and soft - very comfortable . i 'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item . i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large ."
__label__0 "this runs small i got the size 3 which fits like a medium not a large . its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy . i loved the elbow length sleeves . i have a large 34g bust and although this fit it came to the top of my waist and i 'm short-waisted . it 's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length ."
__label__1 "i loved this dress as soon as i tried it on but ... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips . i ordered a second size 4 hoping that it would fit better . but same thing . if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else . fyi - i 'm 5 ' 8 129lbs and i 'm a runner . it 's not like i have a huge backside or anything . my guess is sizing is off . i 've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to receive this dress . i got a petite 4 as i am 5 ' 2 . it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible . it did n't look good on me . the waist line was a bit too high ... maybe a regular would have looked better . also i thought it was a cotton dress but it is n't . also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance . i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just did n't work for me and i had to send it back ."
__label__1 "these are really cute pants . nice flowy fabric - perfect for dressing up or down from spring to fall . the only problem for me was the sizing . i tried my usual xs/0 ( 5 ' 7 115lbs ) but they were huge - as in pulled them on without realizing there was actually a zipper opening ! i then decided to try the petitie in the xs and those fit perfectly but unfortunately they were too short . the regular length were too long and would have needed hemming but that would not have bothered me as it would have"
__label__0 "the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person . the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i 'd imagined from the photos . it has a quilted quality so does n't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms . i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large . i think a medium might have been better . have n't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return . has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like ."
__label__1 "just received this gorgeous blouse and i could n't be happier ! it 's stunning ! not sheer at all but light and breezy . i typically wear a medium sometimes a small but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me . this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i 've been looking for all spring . the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue . a perfect find !"
__label__0 "i love the fabric and design of these leggings but unfortunately they ran way to big up top . they literally fall down ."
__label__1 "i have a casual oceanside wedding to attend and thought this easy yet elegant dress would be a good purchase . i initially bought two sizes : 10 and 12. i 'm typically a 12 in more structured dresses ( i.e . more rigid fabric with zippered entry ) but because this dress was flowy and slipped on over the head i also ordered the 10. i 'm 5 ' 5 broader shoulders 36d with smaller hips that are typically one size smaller than my top half . the 12 ended up being comically huge and fit like a tent . the 10"

__label__1 "i bought this dress for work and post work happy hours . love it ! it 's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure . it 's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited to get this dress i initially ordered a small ( i am a size 4 ) but when i tried it on it was really tight . the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit and the dress just looked off . i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there and the look of the dress on line was beautiful but just did n't fit right . i did love the lace look and would love seeing more dresses with this design ."
__label__0 "this dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front . i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face . all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx . $ 250 was too much to spend on this ."
__label__0 "i saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design . purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight . i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately even the size 6 just did not fit right . moving around in the dress was challenging ; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up . i was constantly pulling it down . the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy . overall it 's a cute dress but just not for me ."
__label__1 "i ordered this online having never seen it in person . i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material . it fits me perfectly ... i almost invariably wear a size 6 in retailer dresses and tops which gave me the confidence to order online and this dress is true to size . the detailing at the bosom is so flattering . the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my not-so-perfect waistline . i have worn this twice already having received it only a week ago . the blue/black combi"

__label__1 "while overall it 's a pretty top there were a few surprises . the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band ! without it the top would be wide longer and flow . in the picture to get it to the length shown the elastic is pulled up toward the waist . which could work for some as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look . it could be cut off and sewn making a normal flowy top . i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off and the sleeve length is long with elastic"
__label__1 "these pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist . going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride . they fit true to size . could not pass up as they were on sale ."
__label__-1 "i tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 ( a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea ) . the 4 fit in the outer layer however as the previous poster mentioned the lining is super tight . i could n't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips . the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining . not sure what when wrong here but it 's a shame because it 's a really cute dress ."
__label__0 "beautiful dress but the fit was off for me . overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail . as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute . i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top . i 'm 5 ' 6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small the top just hung off of me . perhaps it would have been better with an xs ."
__label__-1 "do n't even waste your money even on sale . bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers . unfortunately one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through . one of the other colors was fine yet still pilled pretty bad . the third one still has the tag . keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock"

__label__0 "this beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store . the coloring is lovely but it was too short for me ( 5 ' 7 ) and just meh ... and it was only on for a second before it started itching . sadly too the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes ( i wish they 'd stop doing this ) . if it works for you great because it 's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter"

__label__1 "i 'm petite and pear shaped so i 'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits . it 's a relaxed fit so it 's not super fitted and it 's loose around the waist which is great . it 's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots . i adore it !"

__label__0 "what a huge disappointment ! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust . if you have any semblance of a chest this is not for you ! i am a 38c and this was a no go . the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no . it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms ."

__label__0 "got them in the light blue . i 'm 5 ' 0 so they 're a little long . i like the texture and they are really comfortable ! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really ca n't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top ."

__label__0 "i love this dress i mean it si really pretty in person however the breast area is just too small ... i ca n't wear a bra with it and my older breasts just droop not flattering . they are barely covered ... i am a bit disappointed at that but if you are smaller up there i say give it a try ... i am 115 lbs 26.5 ion waist 30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest . colors and fabric are great i love that the different colors are different types of fabric ... too bad ."
__label__-1 "i disagree with other reviewers on this . it looks a lot better in picture on the model . i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way . fabric feels great . i want to love it but it is going back ."

__label__-1 "this nightgown looked so comfy and cute ! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i 'm 5 ' 3 and 150lbs . it was such a shame . size large should not just be really a medium !"
__label__-1 "this looked fabulous on the model of course and i love sweater dresses . but even in an xs i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous . concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere . a definite return ."
__label__1 "just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size . the cut and shape are very flattering with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist . in person the color looks very different than on the website . it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me . one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat . since this jumpsuit is so cute i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top ! on me it was weirdly boxy . it was too wide and too short and it was more sheer than i expected it . the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly . i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has . i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy . unfortunately it will be going back ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim . it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6 but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses . i am 5 ' 8 small busted and a pear shape so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt . i love the length hitting just below the knee . it is flattering for my body type . seems well made and at a good price point ."

__label__1 "i am in love with this dress . ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 ( i go back and forth ) and this time i kept the six . there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe . i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it 's appropriate for work and for an evening out ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful top however my top did not match the one in the picture it 's so odd the stripes are completely different it 's ok because it 's very pretty but i do like the one pictured better . it 's too short on me for leggings and boots but it 's great with skinny jeans . very pretty and soft material ."
__label__0 "beautiful . got several compliments when wearing it . does not hold up with washes though . threads unraveling everywhere . i am thinking of returning it for this reason . fits true to size . i am 5 ' 4 118 lbs xs fit . i am smaller on top ."

__label__-1 "i love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite . i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand . this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress . the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame . not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment . i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me . i returned this dress ."

__label__0 "there is a lot of fabric here ! the legs fit me fine but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area . i 've also found that they do n't stay rolled up in the back especially if you sit down . it 's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable . maybe sizing down would 've helped but i doubt that would 've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up ."
__label__-1 "i truly can not understand the great reviews on this dress ! i purchased in both a sp and a mp . i am 5 ' 2 120 # . the mp fit perfectly . i definitely would n't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together . it 's not super soft coarse on the inside and feels old . the back is longer than the front it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps . even with leggings and great boots it looks worn ."
__label__1 "this dress is very comfortable not itchy at all and looks great . runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it 's still a worthwhile buy !"
__label__-1 "although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well it really did not lay right on me . i 'm a 34d and i got my usual size in a small . the arm holes were a bit too big the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me ."
__label__1 "i went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews but i should have ordered my own size as they 're a bit loose around the waist . the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering so i definitely recommend them !"

__label__0 "thought i 'd love this top ; i 'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer . but i found the lace while pretty to be quite rough which to me indicates a lower quality . and i guess i should 've known that it would be very swingy ( photos show that ) but it really overwhelmed me . for reference 5 ' 5 125 lbs 34d . sad but this went back ."

__label__1 "the top runs small it is a very sexy and slimming top . i tried in l it was too small so i have ordered it in xl . i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this . but it is a very sexy good looking and slimming top . i love it ! !"

__label__-1 "like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short . i 'm only 5 ' 2 ( xs ) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model . also the quality is n't great as it 's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front . it 's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique . sadly it 's going back !"

__label__0 "what i liked : 1. midweight fabric . it 's not lined and when i read polyester in the description i was worried that it might be thin but this is a stretchy midweight fabric . 2. pretty pretty print what i did not like : 1. i do n't know what dress the model is wearing but this was an empire waist dress on me . i 'm 5 ' 7 . because it was empire waist the long hem makes this look like a maternity dress on me . 2. the sleeves are cut oddly . they look too wide for the dress even on this model . 3"

__label__-1 "these pants look beautiful when you first see them . it goes downhill from there . the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants . it felt fine when pulled up but it is a struggle . i could get past that but when i looked in the mirror i could see right through them . no lining and not very thick material for this price ! ! ! a real bummer especially since it was a birthday gift ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy . it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear . the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions . it was n't as elegant as the model pic ( is it ever ? ) and for this price should fit like a glove . went back within seconds . also it 's pretty short and bulky short is n't flattering on too many people ."

__label__-1 "the colors in this dress are beautiful ( the green/blue version ) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy . i purchased it online and was n't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown i really wanted to love it but it 's going back ."

__label__0 "i like the feel stretch and softness of this dress it 's very comfortable . sadly as others have commented the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me . i considered sizing down to a 4 but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area . unfortunately it will have to go back . i am 5 ' 7 120 lbs 34d and ordered a 6 ."
__label__0 "i thought this top was absolutely beautiful ! i could n't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me . ( i 'm 5 ft 105 lbs and got the pxs ) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit . i 'm very disappointed i really wanted this top to work ."

__label__-1 "my perspective is as a sewer so i 'm more picky perhaps . this top is poorly made . the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece . sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric . it looks sloppy . the cut is very full ; the bottom edge measures 104 around . for my figure curvey at 5 ' 6 and 150lbs this top is not flattering it looks maternity . perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings ."

__label__0 "i ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year . not so . this year 's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer . there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors . too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year . i guess we are all different . at 5 ' 7 115lbs i prefe"
__label__-1 "i agree with other reviewer the material of these jeans is not the same ! thin stretches and you end up pulling them up all the time . i am a short curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back ! this seems to be the trend in jeans ? nydj also uses this fabric ? stretches too much ."
__label__0 "the collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste . the color and fabric is really nice . just wish the collar was different ."
__label__0 "this is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning . this would be best for very thin petties or tall women . i 'm 5 ' 4 125 # 27/4 and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick . the length was great though . sad it did n't work out"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful piece -- and a really great deal on sale . it is sheer but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit !"
__label__1 "i 'm a big fan of left of center as a brand and this top is definitely a winner ! the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim . the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like . highly recommend !"
__label__-1 "way too much fabric ; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek ! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric but the extra fabric just piles up on itself ... the outer layer also does n't feel like it will breath . add the cotton lining and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer . returning ."
__label__1 "the first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric did n't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue . i 'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage which was a nice surprise because i usually avoid anything with fullness . will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect . i 'm short 5 ' 3 . neckline is fem"
__label__-1 "i would have kept this dress if it were n't for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides . other than that it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice substantial material ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love these but they 're so tight around the top . my legs are normal size and i could n't get them above my knee . the top is n't stretchy ... it has a string that keeps it from expanding . they are so very cute but unfortunately must go back for me ."
__label__-1 "this would be a great blouse for flat chested person . i am a size 12 and busty . i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through . you would need to wear a cami under it ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1 ) older and do n't want to show off that much leg anymore and 2 ) are curvy on the bottom and really can not wear the shorter shorts . i ordered these immediately in the navy . i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans and like the other reviewer observed as well i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere . the legs are big - but it 's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that but they just are"
__label__-1 "bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me . the colors were n't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge . not flattering and it went back . i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved . not hard to do at all"
__label__0 "my first complaint is this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around ( not all the way ) you can see the pin in the back . that should have been a clue that this dress is n't meant to fit anyone properly if it does n't fit the model . i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long . you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top or the fabr"
__label__-1 "unfortunately does not look anything like in the picture . looks like an oversized house robe . i expected much more but was disappointed . i am definitely returning it ."
__label__0 "love pilcro love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting . i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight . i guess its just the cut/fabric combo . i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you however !"
__label__1 "i ordered this in xs i 'm 5 ' 4 around 115lbs and it fits perfectly . the material is very soft but not see-through and the romper is well-made . i wish it came in other colours i 'd buy more !"
__label__-1 "this dress overwhelmed me . i 'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over ."
__label__-1 "the quality is good as is the design idea but practically it does n't work . ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly . this top is not soft or flowy it is stiff and very wide ."
__label__0 "this dress is very pretty and we 'll made . it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down ."
__label__0 "i love this top and the beading is beautiful but just like everyone else it was way too large . i normally wear a lg but the large looks and feels like a 3xl . beautiful but large"
__label__0 "i thought this dress was very cute on the model however it was way too tight across the chest for me . going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else . also fabric was n't great ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress online and i thought it was perfectly cute ! however once i tried it on at home it just did n't work . one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning and once i got it on the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm . ( i 'm 5 ' 7 '' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2 ) . i did n't even try buttoning all the way . i took it back and i do n't even think i want a larger size . the buttons are just too fragile ."
__label__-1 "this looked nothing like the picture on me . was long and very unflattering . belled out greatly at the bottom also . the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality . but overall awkward ."
__label__0 "the shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in real life . size was not wrong the material was just very clingy . i was not impressed and subsequently returned it ."
